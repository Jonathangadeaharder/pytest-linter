# Magic Assert Allowlist (W9012: pytest-mnt-magic-assert)
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Specify values that should NOT trigger magic constant warnings.
# By default, 0, 1, -1, True, False, None, and "" are allowed.
# Add domain-specific constants that are meaningful in your codebase.

    400, 401, 403, 404, 409,  # Client errors

    # Your domain-specific constants
    # Add values that are self-documenting in your domain

# Future Configuration Options
# -----------------------------
# These are planned but not yet implemented:

# network-import-allowlist = [
#     # Allow specific network modules if they're mocked
#     "requests",  # If using pytest-mock
# ]

# cwd-dependency-allowlist = [
#     # Allow specific CWD functions in certain contexts
# ]

# fixture-autouse-allowlist = [
